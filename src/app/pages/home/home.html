      <p class="msc-hero-sub">
        My Scottsdale Confections is a bakery created for kids and families to
        come in, decorate, make a little mess, and feel at home. We invite kids
        into the “kitchen” experience so they can mix, frost, and create.
      </p>

      <p class="msc-hero-sub">
        All kids are welcome — including autistic and neurodivergent kids —
        with patient staff, flexible party options, and space for quiet breaks
        when anyone needs them.
      </p>

      <p class="msc-hero-sub">
        A portion of every party and pop‑up goes back to local schools and
        community programs in Scottsdale, so each cupcake helps our neighbors.

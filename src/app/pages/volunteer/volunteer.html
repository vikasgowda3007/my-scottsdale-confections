    <h2>Our story</h2>
    <p>
      My Scottsdale Confections began as a small home kitchen project and grew
      into a community confection spot filled with sprinkles, smiles, and
      sweet‑tooth volunteers.

      <h3>Baked with love (and lots of frosting)</h3>
      <p>
        This is where you can tell your story — how you started baking, your
        first cupcakes, and the moment you decided to turn it into a real
        Scottsdale business.

        Volunteers help with everything from frosting cupcakes to packing
        cookie boxes for local events and causes you care about.
